# Synchronization
Simulation of synchronization of connecting devices to a router (for an example)
It's implemented with 4 classes:
    1- Network class (main class)
    2- Device class
    3- Router class
    4- Semaphore class


*** Important Note ***
    --> After inserting the devices you want , you'll wait a few seconds as the output is inserted to text file so after 
    the process finished , you'll see that a text file has been created with the output
